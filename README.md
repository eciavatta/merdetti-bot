# merdetti-bot ðŸ’©

A Telegram bot that can be used to stamp the card on that horrible platform called Zucchetti.

## Features

- Stamp the entry and exit and get the status of the card ðŸŽ«
- Smart notifications to let you know when you forgot to stamp ðŸ“¢

## Commands

- `/login`: saves the user's credentials to access the platform in memory
- `/timbra`: checks the status of the card and asks the user if they wants to stamp
- `/notifiche`: allows the user to configure notifications
- `/messaggio`: allows admin users to send a message to all users of the bot
- `/entra` e `/esci`: shortcuts to stamp the card (they do not ask for confirmation)

## Remarks

- Thanks to my colleague [Daniele Biasini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-biasini/) who came up with the idea of the bot and wrote its first version
